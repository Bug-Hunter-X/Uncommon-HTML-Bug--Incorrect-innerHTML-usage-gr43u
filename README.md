This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML involving the use of innerHTML. The bug arises when JavaScript attempts to modify the content of an element that is not yet fully rendered in the Document Object Model (DOM). This situation typically occurs when the script attempting to manipulate the element is placed within the `<head>` or before the element declaration in the `<body>`. The solution involves ensuring that the JavaScript executes only after the element is fully rendered.
